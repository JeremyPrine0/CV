         <h3><p><strong>About Me:</strong></p></h3>
       
        <p>I am a husband, father, Army Reserve Officer, and Contract Specialist.</p>
    
           <p class="indent"> I am an Army Reserve Officer. Currently, my unit is mobilized at the Charleston Military Seaport on Joint Base Charleston, SC. 
         Under normal conditions, Charleston Military Seaport is the busiest strategic seaport on the Eastcoast. Additionally, however, the White House 
         has designated Charleston as the port for all Presidentially Directed cargo for Ukrainian aid. All our operations are considered 
         "high visibility" because of extreme oversight of the White House. I am the Officer in Charge (OIC) of the team of Soldiers who manage terminal
        operations. I am totally responsible and personally accountable for everything my team does or fails to do. My Soldiers get the credit for all successes
        and I am responsible for anything that should have happened. I have personally touched every piece of Presidentially Directed Ukrainian cargo that has embarked from the 
        United States since November 2022. It is a good feeling to know my work here is helping patriots in Eastern Europe win their freedom.</p class="indent">

            <p>In addition to our Ukrainian Aid operations, we are also responsible for US Army units deploying to destinations across the globe. We conduct
        logistical planning, port staging, port clearance, cargo documentation, and vessel operations for US Army units departing for Europe (EUCOM), 
        Africa (AFRICOM), and the Middle East (CENTCOM). We regularly deploy Brigade Combat Teams consisting of thousands of vehicles and pieces of equipment. The amount of
        logistical planning that goes into moving massive Army units and all their equipment from a base in the United States to another part of the planet is 
        enormous. We coordinate with rail carriers, line-haul operators, cargo vessel operators, and Unionized labor. The planning starts months in advance.</p>

        <p>I support the Army's mission in a civilian copacity as well. I work as a Contract Specialist for the Mission Installation Contract Command (MICC) at Fort Carson, Colorado. 
        I work in the construction division of Contract Command. My role specializes in cradle to grave contract management for construction projects on Fort Carson. I have managed 
        several million dollars worth of construction contracts.</p>

        <h3><strong>My Personal Philosophy:</strong></h3>

        <p>In my private life I strive for growth. I want to be the best man possible for my family. I understand that growth involves pain, but I believe it is 
        my mission to set the example for my children and to be mentally and emotionally available for my wife. My wife and I have fostered a number of children and give 
        heavily to our favorite charity for women and children. We believe time is one's most valuable asset and that money should be used to obtain financial freedom.
        After we achieve financial freedom, we believe all our time and money should be used to help children. All of my work and investing activities are focused on the 
        goal of obtaining financial freedom and then using our time to help children We see no reason to stay in the rat race. We believe in investing to exit the rat race
        in order to do something meaningful. A life without purpose is a life not worth living.</p>

        <h3><strong>Media Coverage of Our Accomplishments at Joint-Base Charleston:</strong></h3>

        <p>The high visibility nature of my team's mission at Charleston Military Port means we are constantly in the spotlight. In January 2023, President 
            Joe Biden announced the United States would be sending 60 Bradley Fighting Vehicles to the Ukrainian Army. We received these vehicles in February 2023.
            Since then our missions have generated much media attention.
